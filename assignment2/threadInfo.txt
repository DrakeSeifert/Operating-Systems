First thread contains mutex, create a lock in the thread
Second thread starts, tries to grab mutex
It cannot because it has been blocked. First thread continues as usual.
Eventually user enters "time"
This causes the primary thread to unlock
The second thread can now do what it needs to->grab time file and 
	terminate
join function will stop primary thread from continuing until second 
	thread is finished
Repeat the process
